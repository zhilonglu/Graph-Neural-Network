## Motivation of GNN
* The first motivation of GNNs roots in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
* The other motivation comes from graph embedding, which learns to represent graph nodes, edges or subgraphs in low-dimensional vectors.

## GNN worth investigating
* GNNs propagate on each node respectively, ignoring the input order of nodes
* GNNs can do propagation guided by the graph structure instead of using it as part of features
* GNNs explore to generate the graph from non structural data like scene pictures and story documents, which can be a powerful neural model for further high-level AI.
